# RTTrafficManagement
An attempt to prove the theory that you can optimize the arrival times of emergency services in the UK by modulating traffic flow based on the emergency vehicle's GPS path, prioritising the emergency vehicle over the general public.

My university lecturer said he and some others mathematically proved that it could save time for EMS, logically this makes sense.
I thought I'd make an actual traffic simulator so that I can try different methods for optimizing routes instead of re-routing when congestion is encountered.
